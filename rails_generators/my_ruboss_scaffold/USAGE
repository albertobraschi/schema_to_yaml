Based off ruboss_yaml_scaffold generator from *ruboss4ruby gem
*http://github.com/dima/ruboss4ruby/tree/master

Description:
    Scaffolds an entire application based on db/model.yml file.  You can generate
    the model.yml file using [rake db:schema:to_yaml] if you have an existing
    schema.  I suggest using the *auto_migrations plugin from PJ Hyett.

    It will basically read in each model from the model.yml and call
    the_magic_sauce generator on each of the models.  This has been changed
    over the ruboss4ruby version.  Please see README.doc for examples.

Examples:
    `./script/generate my_ruboss_scaffold`
